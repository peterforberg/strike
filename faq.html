    <h1><span>Will we go on strike?</span></h1>
    <p>Union leadership has not announced plans to hold a strike authorization vote (SAV). So, there are a few
      possibilities: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>We agree to a contract by 12/31</li>
      <li>We work without a contract after 12/31</li>
      <li>Leadership extends the contract past 12/31</li>
      <li>Leadership announces an SAV after 12/31</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It's impossible to predict what will happen, but even if we <i>don't go on strike</i>, it's essential that we
      prepare for a strike. If the university doesn't believe that we can successfully withhold our labor and fight for
      our demands, then they have no reason to compromise with our bargaining team.</p>
    <h1><span>Why is bargaining not working?</span></h1>
    <p>As union leadership has repeatedly told us, the administration is fearful of a crackdown by Trump and is
      reluctant to give into any economic demands. While it is true that Trump has leveraged his presidency to tighten
      research budgets, unlawfully disappear students, and restrict free speech, we have no reason to believe that
      acquiescing to Trump's demands will actually protect us from his furor. Still, the administration seems to hope
      that by parroting his langauge and grievances, they will avoid punishment. So, instead of negotiating, they can
      continue to stall and hope that we will submit to their proposals. Without coordinated labor action, the
      university has no reason to side with us over Trump.</p>
    <h1><span>If we go on strike, will we still get paid?</span></h1>
    <p>Yes. UAW members are asked to pay dues, the bulk of which go to a strike defense fund, which can be used to pay
      striking workers. If we go on strike, members will receive $500 a week for the duration of the strike.</p>
    <h1><span>What are we demanding from the university?</span></h1>
    <p>Last year, the union conducted a bargaining survey and hosted a bargaining convention to determine our priorities
      for our contract negotiations. You can read about these initial demands on the union's <a
        href="https://www.uaw4811.org/initial-bargaining-demands-1">bargaining website.</a> In short, the list of
      demands includes:
    <ul>
      <li>Pay equity across campuses</li>
      <li>Increased minimum wage</li>
      <li>Inflation-adjusted wages</li>
      <li>Stable funding</li>
      <li>Protections for international and immigrant workers</li>
      <li>Protections against abuse, harassment, and discrimination</li>
      <li>Improved childcare and parental leave</li>
      <li>Improved access to affordable housing</li>
      <li>Financial transparency</li>
      <li>Retirement divestment from weapons manufacturing</li>
      <li>Continued access to contraceptive and gender-affirming care</li>
      <li>Increased protections for free speech on campus</li>
      <li>Improved work-life balance (e.g., class size limits, paid leave)</li>
      <li>Improved grievance resolutions and strike protections</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
